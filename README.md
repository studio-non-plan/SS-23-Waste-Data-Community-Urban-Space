# Waste: Data, Community & Urban Space 
"""‘More than buildings, forms, materials or structures, it is architecture's ability to alter how we see the world that is its most precious and powerful gift.’ - writes Lesley Lokko, curator of the 18th Venice Architecture Biennale 2023 in her statement. 

The Liechtenstein contribution takes up exactly this idea and shows the invisible bond between Liechtenstein and Africa, which through our actions changes living spaces, social spaces and social structures in an inclusive and global society. Liechtenstein and Africa are connected, even if this is unconscious on both sides. Every year Liechtenstein exports several hundred tons of e-waste.  

E-waste has now taken on a global dimension and is also relevant for small countries like Liechtenstein. Is e-waste trash or a valuable resource? What would change if exports were successively reduced? In Africa? And in Liechtenstein? 

As in a laboratory, we take two comparable variables to experiment with. On a macro level, we look at the connection between Liechtenstein and Agbogbloshie (the largest electronic waste dump in Africa) and the changes in structures due to the reduction of e-waste - spatial as well as social. On a micro level, we look at the details of people's everyday lives once confronted with the issue. 

For the exhibition, research questions are to be answered and data collection carried out in Ghana and in Liechtenstein through various activities in the University of Lichtenstein. Scientific methods for data collection, analysis, evaluation, and visualization of the results are taught.
